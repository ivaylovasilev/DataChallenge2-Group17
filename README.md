Key Features:
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of comments, classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Categorical Analysis: Sorts comments into predefined themes (similar to those used for news analysis) such as violence, policy changes, and police-community interactions.
Engagement Metrics: Analyzes engagement through likes, views, and comment counts to assess the publicâ€™s reaction to the content.

How to Use:
API Key Configuration: Ensure you have a valid YouTube API key configured in the script.
Run the Script: Execute the script to start collecting and analyzing data. The results will provide insights into public sentiment and help identify trends over time.
